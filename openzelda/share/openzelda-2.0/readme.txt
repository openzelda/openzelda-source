History

Open Zelda was a project started by Greg Denness aka 'GD', originally as a 
freeware game base on the Zelda universe, then a Zelda Game Maker then 
finally as a generalize Game Maker.

In late December 2002, 'GD' release the source under the GPL v2 to sourceforge.
The project tried to evolve into Open Legends, which plan to supports more 
then just Zelda games and add new features such as networking.

Open Legends failed in 2006, but one of it's members created Mokoi Gaming, 
which offered most of the features plan for Open Zelda.

Then in 2009, after failed attempt by others to create Open Zelda 7, a 
modified version of Mokoi Gaming was release to serve as the next generation 
of Open Zelda.
